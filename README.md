# Practice Problems
These are some coding problems I have solved from various sources. Within each folder there is a primary `.js` file that will mention the source of the problem.


### Technology Used:
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript testing framework

### Getting Started:

To run tests, first choose which problem (folder) you would like to access.

Make a clone.

Install dependencies from `package.json`.

  ```
  $ npm i
  ```

Run the test with 

  ```
  $ jest
  ```
or
  ```
  $ npm test
  ```
